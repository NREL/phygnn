**phygnn** (fi-geon | \ ˈfi-jən) noun.

    1. a physics-guided neural network
    2. a rare and mythical bird

This implementation of physics-guided neural networks augments a traditional
neural network loss function with a generic loss term that can be used to
guide the neural network to learn physical or theoretical constraints.
phygnn enables scientific software developers and data scientists to easily
integrate machine learning models into physics and engineering applications.
This framework should help alleviate some challenges that are often encountered
when applying purely data-driven machine learning models to scientific
applications, such as when machine learning models produce physically
inconsistent results or have trouble generalizing to out-of-sample scenarios.

For details on the phygnn class framework see `the phygnn class documentation
here. <https://nrel.github.io/phygnn/_autosummary/phygnn.phygnn.PhysicsGuidedNeuralNetwork.html>`_

For example notebooks using the phygnn architecture for regression,
classification, and even GAN applications, see `the example notebooks here.

At the National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL), we are using the phygnn framework
to supplement traditional satellite-based cloud property prediction models. We
use phygnn to predict cloud optical properties when the traditional mechanistic
models fail and use a full tensor-based radiative transfer model as the
physical loss function to transform the predicted cloud properties into
phygnn-predicted irradiance data. We then calculate a loss value comparing the
phygnn-predicted irradiance to high quality ground measurements. We have seen
excellent improvements in the predicted irradiance data in rigorous
out-of-sample-validation experiments (Buster et al. 2021).

Engineers and researchers can use the phygnn framework to:

    * Enforce physically-consistent predictions from a deep neural network (see lake temperature reference below)
    * Implement custom regularization (e.g. topological regularization)
    * Use the physics loss function to extend training data, e.g. train against "known" outputs but also train using the downstream application of the predicted variables
    * Use the physics loss function to adjust theoretical models based on empirical observation using respective loss weights
