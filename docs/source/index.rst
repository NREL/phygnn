PHYGNN documentation
*******************

What is PHYGNN?
=============
PHYGNN stands for **Physics-Guided Neural Networks**.

This implementation of Physics-Guided Neural Networks augments a traditional 
neural network loss function with a generic loss term that can be used to 
guide the neural network to learn physical or theoretical constraints.
PHYGNN enables scientific software developers and data scientists to easily 
integrate machine learning models into physics and engineering applications.
